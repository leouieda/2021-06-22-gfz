# Open-science for gravimetry: tools, challenges, and opportunities

Online talk given at the
[GFZ Helmholtz Centre Potsdam](https://www.gfz-potsdam.de/)
about my work in open-source gravimetry,
the [Fatiando a Terra](https://www.fatiando.org) project,
and open practices in science.

## Abstract

The Fatiando a Terra project is a collection of open-source Python libraries
for geophysics which cover a range of functionalities, from data download and
processing to modeling and inversion.
Many of our tools are general purpose but we also focus on gravimetry and
magnetometry.
Development on the projected started in 2010 and has gone through several
iterations as the team matured and established best practices for maintaining
software projects in the open.

This talk is an overview of the history and current iteration of the project,
including a short demonstration of our current capabilities for downloading and
processing gravity data.
We will then move on to our plans for future directions of the projects and
information of how you can get involved.
Finally, we will briefly discuss some of the challenges and opportunities of
adopting open-science practices.
